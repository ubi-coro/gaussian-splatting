# Optimizer

The optimizer uses PyTorch and CUDA extensions in a Python environment to produce trained models.

## Setup

### Local Setup

Our default, provided install method is based on Conda package and environment management:
```shell
SET DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1 # Windows only
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate gaussian_splatting
```
Please note that this process assumes that you have CUDA SDK **11** installed, not **12**. For modifications, see below.

> [!TIP]
> Downloading packages and creating a new environment with Conda can require a significant amount of disk space. By default, Conda will use the main system hard drive. You can avoid this by specifying a different package download location and an environment on a different drive:
>
> ```shell
> conda config --add pkgs_dirs <Drive>/<pkg_path>
> conda env create --file environment.yml --prefix <Drive>/<env_path>/gaussian_splatting
> conda activate <Drive>/<env_path>/gaussian_splatting
> ```

### Modifications

If you can afford the disk space, we recommend using our environment files for setting up a training environment identical to ours. If you want to make modifications, please note that major version changes might affect the results of our method. However, our (limited) experiments suggest that the codebase works just fine inside a more up-to-date environment (`Python 3.8`, `PyTorch 2.0.0`, `CUDA 12`). Make sure to create an environment where PyTorch and its CUDA runtime version match and the installed CUDA SDK has no major version difference with PyTorch's CUDA version.

### Known Issues

Some users experience problems building the submodules on Windows (```cl.exe: File not found``` or similar). Please consider the workaround for this problem from the FAQ.

## Running

To run the optimizer, simply use

```shell
python train.py -s <path to COLMAP or NeRF Synthetic dataset>
```

Note that similar to MipNeRF360, we target images at resolutions in the 1-1.6K pixel range. For convenience, arbitrary-size inputs can be passed and will be automatically resized if their width exceeds 1600 pixels. We recommend to keep this behavior, but you may force training to use your higher-resolution images by setting ```-r 1```.

The MipNeRF360 scenes are hosted by the paper authors [here](https://jonbarron.info/mipnerf360/). You can find our SfM data sets for Tanks&Temples and Deep Blending [here](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/datasets/input/tandt_db.zip). If you do not provide an output model directory (```-m```), trained models are written to folders with randomized unique names inside the ```output``` directory. At this point, the trained models may be viewed with the real-time viewer (see further below).

## Evaluation

By default, the trained models use all available images in the dataset. To train them while withholding a test set for evaluation, use the ```--eval``` flag. This way, you can render training/test sets and produce error metrics as follows:

```shell
python train.py -s <path to COLMAP or NeRF Synthetic dataset> --eval # Train with train/test split
python render.py -m <path to trained model> # Generate renderings
python metrics.py -m <path to trained model> # Compute error metrics on renderings
```

If you want to evaluate our [pre-trained models](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/datasets/pretrained/models.zip), you will have to download the corresponding source data sets and indicate their location to ```render.py``` with an additional ```--source_path/-s``` flag. Note: The pre-trained models were created with the release codebase. This code base has been cleaned up and includes bugfixes, hence the metrics you get from evaluating them will differ from those in the paper.
```shell
python render.py -m <path to pre-trained model> -s <path to COLMAP dataset>
python metrics.py -m <path to pre-trained model>
```

We further provide the ```full_eval.py``` script. This script specifies the routine used in our evaluation and demonstrates the use of some additional parameters, e.g., ```--images (-i)``` to define alternative image directories within COLMAP data sets. If you have downloaded and extracted all the training data, you can run it like this:

```shell
python full_eval.py -m360 <mipnerf360 folder> -tat <tanks and temples folder> -db <deep blending folder>
```

In the current version, this process takes about 7h on our reference machine containing an A6000. If you want to do the full evaluation on our pre-trained models, you can specify their download location and skip training. 

```shell
python full_eval.py -o <directory with pretrained models> --skip_training -m360 <mipnerf360 folder> -tat <tanks and temples folder> -db <deep blending folder>
```

If you want to compute the metrics on our paper's [evaluation images](https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/evaluation/images.zip), you can also skip rendering. In this case it is not necessary to provide the source datasets. You can compute metrics for multiple image sets at a time. 

```shell
python full_eval.py -m <directory with evaluation images>/garden ... --skip_training --skip_rendering
```
