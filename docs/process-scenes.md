## Processing your own Scenes

Our COLMAP loaders expect the following dataset structure in the source path location:

```
<location>
|---images
|   |---<image 0>
|   |---<image 1>
|   |---...
|---sparse
    |---0
        |---cameras.bin
        |---images.bin
        |---points3D.bin
```

For rasterization, the camera models must be either a SIMPLE_PINHOLE or PINHOLE camera. We provide a converter script ```convert.py```, to extract undistorted images and SfM information from input images. Optionally, you can use ImageMagick to resize the undistorted images. This rescaling is similar to MipNeRF360, i.e., it creates images with 1/2, 1/4 and 1/8 the original resolution in corresponding folders. To use them, please first install a recent version of COLMAP (ideally CUDA-powered) and ImageMagick. Put the images you want to use in a directory ```<location>/input```.
```
<location>
|---input
    |---<image 0>
    |---<image 1>
    |---...
```
 If you have COLMAP and ImageMagick on your system path, you can simply run 
```shell
python convert.py -s <location> [--resize] #If not resizing, ImageMagick is not needed
```
Alternatively, you can use the optional parameters ```--colmap_executable``` and ```--magick_executable``` to point to the respective paths. Please note that on Windows, the executable should point to the COLMAP ```.bat``` file that takes care of setting the execution environment. Once done, ```<location>``` will contain the expected COLMAP data set structure with undistorted, resized input images, in addition to your original images and some temporary (distorted) data in the directory ```distorted```.

If you have your own COLMAP dataset without undistortion (e.g., using ```OPENCV``` camera), you can try to just run the last part of the script: Put the images in ```input``` and the COLMAP info in a subdirectory ```distorted```:
```
<location>
|---input
|   |---<image 0>
|   |---<image 1>
|   |---...
|---distorted
    |---database.db
    |---sparse
        |---0
            |---...
```
Then run 
```shell
python convert.py -s <location> --skip_matching [--resize] #If not resizing, ImageMagick is not needed
```

### OpenXR support

OpenXR is supported in the branch gaussian_code_release_openxr 
Within that branch, you can find documentation for VR support [here](https://gitlab.inria.fr/sibr/sibr_core/-/tree/gaussian_code_release_openxr?ref_type=heads).
